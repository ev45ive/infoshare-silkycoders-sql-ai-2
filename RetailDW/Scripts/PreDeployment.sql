/*
Pre-deployment script
---------------------
Runs BEFORE the schema diff is applied.

Use it only for operations that must happen before SQLPackage touches the
schema, e.g. disabling SYSTEM_VERSIONING on temporal tables so that columns
can be added to both the current and the history table.

Keep every statement idempotent - this script runs on every publish.

Change log:
- 2026-08-24 | Ticket: DPO-1204 | Mateusz Kulesza | Claude Sonnet 5 | Add + backfill
  SnapshotID on dbo.FactSales/dbo.FactSalesHistory and enforce NOT NULL here, before
  the schema diff runs, so the diff sees an already-compliant column (see note below).
*/
PRINT N'[PreDeployment] start';

-- DPO-1204: dbo.FactSales.SnapshotID ships as NOT NULL with no default.
-- The schema diff (which applies the table model files) runs AFTER this script,
-- so a bare "ADD SnapshotID INT NOT NULL" in the model would fail against a
-- table that already has rows (no default to fill them). Instead: add the
-- column here as NULL, backfill it, then ALTER to NOT NULL here too - by the
-- time the diff runs, dbo.FactSales.sql / dbo.FactSalesHistory.sql already
-- match the live schema (NOT NULL) and the diff is a no-op for this column.
-- Guarded by COL_LENGTH so this migration only ever runs once. Run as dynamic
-- SQL so the (temporal-restricted) UPDATE against FactSalesHistory is only
-- ever parsed/validated when the branch actually executes.
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.FactSales') IS NOT NULL AND COL_LENGTH('dbo.FactSales', 'SnapshotID') IS NULL
